## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0+ deployment target
- macOS with Apple Silicon (recommended for optimal performance)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PanDerm
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open PanDerm.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure Signing**
   - Select your development team in Project Settings
   - Update bundle identifier if needed

4. **Build and Run**
   - Select target device (iPhone 15 Pro recommended for best performance)
   - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run

### Model Setup

The app includes pre-trained Core ML models:
- `PanDerm.mlpackage`: Main classification model
- `PanDerm 2.mlpackage`: Enhanced version with additional features

These models are automatically loaded when the app starts and perform local inference without requiring internet connectivity.

4. View results with confidence scores and recommendations

### 2. Patient Management
1. Navigate to **Patients** tab
2. Tap "+" to add new patients
3. Fill in patient details including risk factors
4. View risk assessments and contact information

### 3. Analysis History
1. Check **History** tab for past analyses
2. Use filters to find specific cases
3. Export data for reporting or external analysis
4. Flag important cases for follow-up

### 4. Settings Configuration
